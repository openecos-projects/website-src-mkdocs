**EDAthon** is a whole-day programming contest (09:00-15:00 programming, 15:30-17:00 seminar) that features interesting and challenging topics in Electronic Design Automation (EDA). This year's event was organized by Dr. **Xie Zhiyao** from the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. It is also a unique opportunity to bring together talents for EDA, which enables the rapid advancement in computer technology. The contest involves solving interesting problems in the broad context of Computer-Aided Design (CAD) of integrated circuits and systems. It emphasizes teamwork, problem-solving skills, and programming techniques for EDA applications.
