# The "Wanxin" open-source chip talent cultivation platform was successfully launched!
On November 8, 2025, the 2025 World Internet Conference Wuzhen Summit Network Information Technology Industry Ecosystem Development Forum was held in Wuzhen, Zhejiang Province. The forum, themed "Working Together to Build an Ecosystem and Share Development Opportunities," explored the future development direction and path of the network information technology industry ecosystem.

At the forum, the open-source chip team of the Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, launched "Wanxin," an open-source chip talent cultivation platform. Since 2018, the team has been developing open-source chip design solutions, launching and deploying multiple projects including "One Student One Chip", open-source EDA, and open-source IP. After six years, the "Wanxin" open-source chip talent cultivation platform was launched. "Wanxin" supports the entire chip design process, providing a one-stop design and tapeout solution for open-source chip talent cultivation. In the future, "Wanxin" will be globally oriented, continuously dedicated to cultivating a large-scale open-source chip talent pool and helping to create a new ecosystem for open-source chip talent cultivation.
